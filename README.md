## Installation

Installing via GitHub:

* Clone repo using HTTPS/SSL
* Include repo manually by downloading ZIP-file

<br>

## Usage
The usage of the website is up to you as a developer. you can either reconstruct the whole website, or change the elements to fit your needs. As a part of the open source policy, youre able to change the elements to design your new website.


### Features
The website contains different functionality such as interactive control-elements, dynamic animations and links to personal profiles. The website is partially responsive, but we are currently working with the issue.

<br>

## Code
The languages used are: JavaScript, CSS and HTML, where libraries and modules within the different languages are used. Some examples of this are; Bootstrap, SCSS and jQuery.

### Content

The website is built around a single-page HTML-file, which is called "index.html". This contains all the main structure of the website, in addition to the text/image-elements.
The repository also contains the CSS/SCSS-files and JS-files that is required to execute the design and functionality of the website.
I mainly used libraries that are already made from different JS-modules and SCSS-libraries. This made it easy to design the website using modules and content that has already been made. 

### Requirements

An IDE for web-development is recommended for developing the website. I personally used WebStorm IDE from JetBrains, but VSC and other free IDEs are also suitable for developing.
