### Screenshots



### Features
The website contains different functionality such as interactive control-elements, dynamic animations and links to personal profiles.


## Code

### Content

The website is built around a single-page HTML-file, which is called "index.html". This contains all the main structure of the website, in addition to the text/image-elements.
The repository also contains the CSS/SCSS-files and JS-files that is required to execute the design and functionality of the website.
I mainly used libraries that are already made from different JS-modules and SCSS-libraries. This made it easy to design the website using modules and content that has already been made. 

### Requirements

An IDE for web-development is recommended for developing the website. I personally used WebStorm IDE from JetBrains, but VSC and other free IDEs are also suitable for developing.
